# ST5188-Statistical-Research-Project
This repository contains the works for ST5188 Statistical Research Project.

ABOUT:

In this project, we propose novel approaches to alleviate over-smoothing in LightGCN to enhance its performance in graph representation learning for recommender systems. By exploring solutions such as cluster-based sampling and dimensionality reduction, our aim is to enhance the performance of LightGCN in graph representation learning for recommender systems, while addressing the limitations and challenges posed by over-smoothing.

This project was completed in fulfillment of the capstone project module, ST5188 Statistical Research Project, as part of the NUS Statistics M.Sc. by Coursework programme.
